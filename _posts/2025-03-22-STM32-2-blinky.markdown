# Blinky on the Nucleo L152RE 
I had this board lying around and it happend to be using a ARM Cortex M3 which is something I am interested in learning the architecture for. So I started with some basic guides from the [stm-base](https://stm32-base.org/guides/) project mentioned in the previous [post](https://skoopsy.dev/stm32/2025/03/14/STM32-1-getting-started.html).
