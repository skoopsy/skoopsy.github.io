In this post we will progress from using the assembler code __asm__("nop") to using a interupt based delay via the libopencm3 library. See [STM32: From Template to Blinky - Building Bluepill Firmware with libopencm3](https://skoopsy.dev/stm32/2025/06/29/STM32-3-blinky-bluepill.html) for how to get a blinky running with libopencm3 on a bluepill using make.
